# hello-world
This will be much like all the other hello world repository
So happy to get into GitHub. I have been having the toughest time with organizing files between my different projects.
This should help me store the best of the best and not have to go looking for the program I want.
I work in facilities of a life science building in Cambridge, MA.
My main job is to maintain and build on the building BMS system (Siemens).
I'm the lead technician of the other trades. 
I have a very good grasp on the building systems and I can figure out any building system. We perform many shutdowns on equipment in the building from plumbing, heating, cooling, ventilation. They come to me when we need to perform a shutdown with the least interuption to the Science. I can usually come up with an inventive way to perform the shutdown and still keep things running.
I started working with raspberry pi units and found them very useful as data loggers. Likely many of the programs I will upload here will be related to that.
I will start with the base programs I usually load into the pi to help me find them, as they move around alot.
I doubt anyone will read this as I'm sure there are thousands of hello-world repositories.
Happy Programming!
